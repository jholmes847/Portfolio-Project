            <p> 
            Went to Arizona State University where I studied Buisness Marketing. Before that I always had a passion for mental health and the way the brain works. After leaving Arizona I embarcked on my journey in healthcare. Working in the mental health field at several treatment facilities I eventually became a Director of one. Where I learned the managment and leardership side of running a buisness of 25 people. After 3 years I eventually learned that I could help people through technology. That is when I started resurching and found a General Assembly. From there I continue to develope skills in several languages that will tragect me into an amazing carreer.

                From traveling and learning about the different cultures. Too working out and hiking around the mountains, I have always loved to find adventures. Cooking and writing is also something that I am very fond of as I have always found it very theraputic.
