          <p>  Went to Arizona State University where I studied Buisness Marketing. Before that I always had a passion for mental health and the way the brain works. After leaving Arizona I embarcked on my journey in healthcare. Working in the mental health field at several treatment facilities I eventually became a Director of one. Where I learned the managment and leardership side of running a buisness of 25 people. After 3 years I eventually learned that I could help people through technology. That is when I started resurching and found a General Assembly. From there I continue to develope skills in several languages that will tragect me into an amazing carreer.

       <button>Hobbies</button>
             <p> From traveling and learning about the different cultures. Too working out and hiking around the mountains, I have always loved to find adventures. Cooking and writing is also something that I am very fond of as I have always found it very theraputic.
